from the leftand right-handed couplings extracted from forward-backward asymmetries and charge asymmetries in two-fermion processes, different high-scale models can be discriminated . One final remark: if something similar like the 2 TeV anomaly in WW/WZ/ZZ at the end of the 8 TeV run or the 750 GeV anomaly in diphotons will remain at the end of run IT or the high-lumi run, then the ILC is the only option in the near future to comfirm or refute such a signal. 3 Summary In this talk I tried to collect the facts in favor of a future high-energy lepton collider with the focus lying on new physics beyond the SM. Both the two main SM pillars, the Higgs boson and top quark measurements serve as indirect tools for new physics searches, but there is also a plethora of direct search opportunities at such a machine. Most prominent examples are dark matter searches, searches for other light weakly coupling particles, and a scan over all weakly interacting particles. The interplay of the ILC with the LHC, but more importantly with future hadron machines is elucidated. Conditions, or better, scenarios for possible BSM discoveries at the ILC have been given. Several prime examples for the BSM potential of the ILC have been highlighted. Acknowledgments JRR wants to thank the organizers for a fantastic conference in the Canadian wilderness.
