dialects considered constitute separate languages may subdialects own
political reasons arabs mostly assert speak single language despite significant issues mutual incomprehensibility among differing spoken versions

fall output employment tradable goods sector may offset growth nonexports sectors especially construction services
increased purchases abroad negative current account balances financed without problem long credit cheap

colloquial dialects vary significantly msa impeding mutual intelligibility
msa acquired formal education spoken natively
language literature official documents formal written media
spoken form msa used formal contexts news bulletins prayers

maltese hassaniya varieties officially written latin alphabet
linguists still differ best classification semitic language subgroups
semitic languages changed significantly protosemitic emergence central semitic languages particularly grammar
southwest various central semitic languages belonging outside ancient south arabian family eg

scholars named variant dialects towns inscriptions discovered dadanitic taymanitic hismaic safaitic
however arguments single ana language language family based shape definite article prefixed h

much new vocabulary used denote concepts arisen industrial postindustrial era especially modern times
former usually acquired families latter taught formal education settings
however studies reporting degree comprehension stories told standard variety among preschoolaged children
result msa generally composed without case distinctions mind proper cases added fact necessary
practical result msa like english standard chinese written strongly determined word order alternative orders used ca emphasis rare
addition lack case marking spoken varieties speakers cannot consistently use correct endings extemporaneous speech
result spoken msa tends drop regularize endings except reading prepared text
citation neededthe numeral system ca complex heavily tied case system
system never used msa even formal circumstances instead significantly simplified system used approximating system conservative spoken varieties
citation neededmsa uses much classical vocabulary eg dhahaba to go present spoken varieties deletes classical words sound obsolete msa
addition msa borrowed coined many terms concepts exist quranic times msa continues evolve
earlier tendency redefine older word although fallen disuse eg htif telephone invisible caller in sufism jardah newspaper palmleaf stalk
the varieties typically unwritten
senegalese government adopted latin script write hassaniya maltese spoken predominantly catholic malta written latin script
muhammad spoke dialect mecca western arabian peninsula dialect quran written
however dialects eastern arabian peninsula considered prestigious time language quran ultimately converted follow eastern phonology
tawleed process giving new shade meaning old classical word
example alhatif lexicographically means one whose sound heard whose person remains unseen
term alhatif used telephone
dialects considered constitute separate languages may subdialects own
political reasons arabs mostly assert speak single language despite significant issues mutual incomprehensibility among differing spoken versions
apt comparison number ways
suggests spoken varieties may linguistically considered separate languages
